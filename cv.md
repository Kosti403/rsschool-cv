### About MÐµ:

A year ago, after graduating from aviation college, I reflected on my life and realized that this was not what I wanted to do.<br>
By chance, I chose Frontend development at one of the universities or courses, which lasted a year.<br>

As I began my studies, I realized that I had previously tried to learn all this,<br>
but had not succeeded due to a lack of a complete picture.<br>
Now, after recently completing this university or course, I find that I lack the experience to start working.<br>

> I want to fill this gap and achieve something real in this field. Thank you to everyone who read this.<br>
